# Intro-component-with-sign-up-form
At first I had it with display block and none but that triggers everything instead of depending on which is empty. So I though adding the elements needed for the ones that have an error.
The problem with this code is that... every time you press submit and it's empty... it will create a new error element. 
I though about creating a [if this id don't exist add it else do nothing] but got no idea how.
Also I wanna add my own error if the email isn't correctly formatted but it keep returning false.
